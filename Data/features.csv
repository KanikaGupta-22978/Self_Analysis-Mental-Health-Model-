(at time i didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) when disclosing i didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; i simply knew i was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that i couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.it was at this point my direct manager and i began an almost daily struggle. after working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad i was doing) i requested increasing my workload. this was never granted; boss said i hadn't proved myself and implied i could not be trusted.two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. they did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. they did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. they most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable i'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh i'm sorry. i was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) accomodations.- there was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). instead they pushed me to take disability leave. i told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. that required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said i didn't qualify for leave. (expensive unnecessary appointment).- the assistance i needed the most at work was understanding: i was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. that was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. he knew something was up but was barred from asking and i was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- accommodations weren't understood by even benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. when in a meeting with my manager supervised by hr i shouldn't feel like i'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether i'm doing anything right. that this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): fucking unacceptable.while i will never return to that company and as such took the severance package i will never agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. i was too expensive in the short term for them; i'm not worth the cost.
